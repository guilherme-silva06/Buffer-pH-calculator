# Buffer-pH-calculator

This repository is for storage of a program made in python and for the updates of it. This program will calculate the potential of hydrogen (pH) of a buffer solution, that is, a solution made from an weak acid and its salt, or an weak base and its salt, with the aim of evoid that pH varie. It's worth mentioning that this is a project of python beginner, so it may contain mistakes, and any constructive critice is welcome.

In order to the calculator work correctly, is important to understand how to use cientific notation on it.
To indicate that a number is being multiplied by ten and raised by the power of some number, you have to do in a different way from the traditional.
       
Examples:
(2.3 * 10^-5) it will look like this: (2.3e-5)
(1.5 * 10^2) it will look like this: (1.5e2)
